## Install Helm

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

## Install Dagknows CLI

```
pip install dagknows --force-reinstall
```

The CLI has some easy wrappers to interact with DagKnows as well as setting up/upgrading proxies.

Configure the DagKnows cli by providing an access token:

## Minikube Setup (if testing on MK)


### Download and Install

Follow this - https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

Shows you how to install on various platfomrs

### Start Minikube

```
minikube start
```

## K8S Setup

TBD

## Initialize a Proxy

Ensure you are in the k8s_build folder (this folder).

Assuming you have setup your DK cli from [here](https://github.com/dagknows/dkproxy/blob/main/README.md), do the following:

1. Create a new proxy (optional - you can an existing one too)

```
dk proxy new <YOUR_PROXY_NAME>
```

2. Get the configs for the proxy you want to run:

```
dk proxy getenv <YOUR_PROXY_NAME>
```

The above will download an `.env` file to [the](the) current folder

3. Now Initialize the k8s proxy with:

```
`dk proxy initk8s <PATH_TO_DOT_ENV_FILE>`
```

The PATH_TO_DOT_ENV_FILE is where the `.env` file was downloaded in the step 2 (getenv)

This will setup your proxy in `./proxies/<YOUR_PROXY_NAME>` folder

## Start your proxy

Go into the newly created proxy folder 

```
cd `./proxies/<YOUR_PROXY_NAME>`
```

## Create your namespace

Regardless of whether you are on minikube or EKS you have to create a namespace for the proxy on your cluster.   This step also only need to be run once per proxy.

```
sh namespace.sh
```

## Setup any access-control and policies

Usually a bunch of roles may need to be created.  And this can also be cluster specific.  Dont worry this is all abstracted in the generated policies.sh file which is created when you run `dk proxy initk8s` above:

```
sh policies.sh
```

## Setup your storage

### Minikube Specific Setup - Mount local folders on minikube

Now ensure minikube has mounted the above created local folders so they are visible to your pods on the MK cluster.  This step only needs to be run once (per proxy install).

```
sh mkmount.sh
```

You should see something like this:

```
 % sh mkmounts.sh
üìÅ  Mounting host path /Users/dkproxy/k8s_build/sridaily/localpv into VM as /minikubemount ...
    ‚ñ™ Mount type:   9p
    ‚ñ™ User ID:      docker
    ‚ñ™ Group ID:     docker
    ‚ñ™ Version:      9p2000.L
    ‚ñ™ Message Size: 262144
    ‚ñ™ Options:      map[]
    ‚ñ™ Bind Address: 127.0.0.1:52825
üöÄ  Userspace file server: ufs starting
‚úÖ  Successfully mounted /Users/dkproxy/k8s_build/sridaily/localpv to /minikubemount

üìå  NOTE: This process must stay alive for the mount to be accessible ...
```

Do not kill this process - open in a new window if necessary (or run as a daemon mode if you are running on a seperate VM).

### Start your Storage

You can setup your storage (storage classes, PVCs, PVs etc) with:

```
sh storage.sh
```

Note that this file is also generated as part of the `dk proxy initk8s` command.   There you can choose whether you want to do local or eks etc.

## Start your cluster!

Once your namespace, policies and storage is setup you can start your cluster:

```
sh.apply.sh
```

## Destroying your proxy

To remove *ALL* resources associated with your proxy cluster do:

```
sh deleteall.sh
```
